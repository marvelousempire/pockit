### Current Status (What’s Done vs What’s Needed)

**✅ Bold = Already Completed**

- **✅ Strong product vision & philosophy**
- **✅ Detailed Feature Ledger**
- **✅ MVP-SCOPE.md document** (ready)
- **✅ Clean README structure**
- **Bolded items above** = We have solid documentation and direction

**🔴 What Still Needs to Be Done (Priority Order)**

1. **Immediate (This Week)**
- Create full GitHub folder structure
- Write final polished `README.md`
- Create `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Create `ROADMAP.md`
2. **MVP Build (Next 4–6 Weeks)**
- Backend foundation (FastAPI + basic LangChain)
- Color Wheel + 0.0–1.0 inputs
- Micro-Question Engine
- Voice memo recording + transcription
- Basic dashboard with early insights
- Simple memory storage
3. **Post-MVP (v0.2 – v1.0)**
- Full Vector Embeddings + RAG
- Advanced Consistency & Pattern engines
- Self-hosted deployment scripts
- Managed hosting option
- Business features (Ownership Fracturing, Node Mapping)
- Sub-agents (trainer, chef, etc.)
4. **Long-term Vision**
- AI-managed server hosting
- Hardware options (Mac Mini / Raspberry Pi touchscreen)
- Multiple subscription tiers (6-month & annual)
- Premium sub-agents marketplace

-----

**Right now we are at the “strong planning” stage** — we have clarity and documents, but **zero code**.

**Next Action Recommendation:**

Would you like me to generate the **final polished README.md** right now so you can push it to GitHub immediately? Or would you prefer the **ARCHITECTURE.md** or full folder setup files first?

Just tell me what to output next and we’ll keep momentum.
